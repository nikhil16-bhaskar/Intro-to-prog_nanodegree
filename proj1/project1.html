<b>Lesson 1: The Basics of the Web and HTML</b>

How the Web Works

The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web page like www.google.com, their computer sends a HTTP Request to a server. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen. This video does a good job of explaining more.

HTML

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain text content which describes "what you see" and markup which describes "how it looks". This video gives a good overview.

Tags and Elements

HTML documents are made of HTML elements. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags. This video explains the distinction well.

Why Computers are Stupid

Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.

Inline vs Block Elements

HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.

HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.

The "tree-like structure" of HTML

The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on...
In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on...

The relationship between indented HTML and boxes

When you read an HTML document as text, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.

Text Editors (for programming)

When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML tag whe
